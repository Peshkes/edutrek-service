# Education Organization Client Management System

## Overview

This project is a full-stack solution designed to manage the clients of an educational organization. It aims to streamline the management of student and staff data, improving operational efficiency and providing a centralized system for client-related tasks.

Currently, the project is in its early development stages, but itâ€™s designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, laying the groundwork for future microservice architecture.

## Technology Stack
* Frontend: React
* Backend: Spring Boot
* Databases:
  * PostgreSQL for handling relational data
  * MongoDB for storing unstructured or semi-structured

## Features

Planned or upcoming features include:

* Authentication and authorization
* Client management (CRUD operations)
* Role-based access control (RBAC) for staff and students
* Multi-database integration for flexible data storage and retrieval
* Reporting tools and analytics for tracking client activity
* Notifications and scheduling (planned as microservices)

## Microservices (Planned)

The project is being built with future scalability in mind. While the current architecture is monolithic, the codebase is structured in such a way that it will be easy to split it into microservices.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository
* Use the Docker `docker-compose up`
